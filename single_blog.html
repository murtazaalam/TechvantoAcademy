                            Creating a custom system can be a daunting task, and without the right planning, a simple project 
                            can turn into a big headache. Having helped a number of schools design and build custom systems, 
                            here are the four things I recommend considering when designing or adopting a Learning Management System.

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Focus on data–for both instructors and students
                                    <p>
                                        We’re obsessed with data these days, and for good reason: it’s relatively easy to get if 
                                        you know what you’re looking for. While you won’t be able to identify everything that’s 
                                        useful upfront, take a step back, and evaluate what you’d hope to learn. Come up with a list 
                                        of the information you need and a list of things you’d like to have. For example, do you need 
                                        to know the average test score for students in History? What about attendance rates during the 
                                        month of December?
                                        <br><br>
                                        Knowing what you’re looking for upfront helps you determine what specific information you’ll 
                                        need to capture from your users.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Design for usability–make it ‘pleasurable’ to use
                                    <p>
                                        Once you know what you need users to tell you, you should make it easy for them to do so. 
                                        Design each component of your LMS with usability in mind. Create a hierarchy of actions you 
                                        need users to take, ranking them in order from essential to nonessential, and use prominent 
                                        buttons, obvious links, and clean copy to direct people to them.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Also, take advantage of what’s out there. Things like social logins, video streaming, shared 
                                        calendars, message boards, and forms are all commonplace on the web, and users know immediately
                                        what to do with them. Take inspiration from Google, Facebook, Microsoft Word, and others to 
                                        learn the common themes of web interfaces and copy them. Your users will thank you.

                                        For a great reference on designing easy-to-use interfaces, I recommend Stephen Krug’s book 
                                        “Don’t Make Me Think.”

                                    Plan for mobile from the very beginning
                                    <p>
                                        As of 2020, there are more than 14 billion mobile devices in use worldwide, a number that’s 
                                        expected to grow to nearly 17 billion by 2023.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Further, more than half of all web traffic is mobile–which means that the likelihood that 
                                        students, parents, faculty, and staff will need to use the LMS on a mobile device is relatively 
                                        high. To optimize their experience, adopt a mobile-first design approach. Rather than building a 
                                        full, standard website and then cutting features or scaling back functionality for a mobile 
                                        version, start by focusing solely on how your LMS looks and works on mobile.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Ask yourself, what are the core tasks teachers, students, parents, administrators need to 
                                        perform? What information and tasks need to be accessible at all times? How does information 
                                        look on small screens? How do you interact with information?
                                        <br><br>
                                        It’s always easier to layer complexity for a desktop experience, but designing for mobile-first 
                                        ensures a seamless experience for users—wherever they are.

                                    Design curriculum and instruction with the strengths of your specific LMS in mind
                                    <p>
                                        Every platform is different and no single approach to LMS creation is perfect. Some work well 
                                        as assessment software while others handle video better. Some or visual while others load 
                                        quickly, are text-based, and use frequent lesson and page loading to move the student through 
                                        material.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Whatever your approach, design what and how the students learn in cooperation with the 
                                        strengths and abilities of the LMS rather than designing digital lessons and units and 
                                        then shoe-horning them into whatever the LMS is able to do.
                                        <br><br>
                                        While the options for customization can be exciting, taking the time to consider these four 
                                        things will help you build the system that meets your needs so that you can focus on the thing 
                                        that matters most—providing a great education to students.
